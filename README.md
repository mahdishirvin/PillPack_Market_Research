Paper about Amazon Pharmacy


● WFM(whole food market) can better support existing grocery customers and bring in new customers.
● WFM will need to look at what “store space” trade-off will need to be made to fit
in this new offering --requires further detailed analysis of product line profitability,
customer foot traffic patterns, and space utilization.
● The Amazon Pharmacy can potentially be a bigger opportunity online for Amazon but that is another analysis.
● Ultimately, this recommendation is about influencing customer behavior to
change how and where they make their pharmacy purchases.
